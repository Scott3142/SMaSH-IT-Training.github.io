            <p class="more">Mathematics and computing are inexorably linked through the application of <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>number theory</strong>. This course introduces the mathematical principles and theory that underpin the computing curriculum. We appreciate that students traditionally find mathematics <strong>less interesting</strong> than the rest of computing, so this course will enable you to see the wider applications of mathematics and their <strong>fundamental applicability</strong> to computing. This course is available for <strong>A-Level/BTEC and above</strong>.</p>

            <p class="more">One of the major ideas in the software industry at the moment is the necessity for <strong>open-source</strong> software, and we commit as a company to open-source resources forever. This course will introduce the concept of open-source, and other commonly used licensing and copyright practises. <br /><br />

 We will also discuss version-control and software development best-practises to enable your students to apply for a software engineer position with a sense of the important ideas in the field. Because of the nature of the content, this course is currently offered at <strong>A-Level/BTEC and above</strong>, although the ideas would be applicable to all software, application and website development techniques across the curriculum.
