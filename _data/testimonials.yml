    Scott Morgan has visited our school to give the children an insight into programming and how it impacts on our life.  The children have gained much from this and it has impacted on their learning in other areas.  For instance their willingness to improve their spelling ability.  This has been part of the schoolâ€™s plan to introduce and embed the Digital Competence Framework.
